I attended University of Maryland, receiving bachelor's degrees in mathematics and computer science
before attending Carnegie Mellon University for my master of arts in philosophy, which I received in 
August 2022. My research interests have been at the intersection of philosophy and computer science,
including causality, decision theory, and ethics of/about AI. My thesis was advised by Professor
Danielle Wenner and focused on how an individual's beliefs affect their conception of themselves
and their relationships with others. A copy of my thesis can be found under the "Projects" tab.

A copy of my resume is also available for download [here][resume].

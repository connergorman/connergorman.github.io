I attended University of Maryland, recieving bachelor's degrees in mathematics and computer science
before attended Carnegie Mellon University for my master of arts in philosophy, which I received in 
August 2022. My research interests have been at the intersection of philosophy and computer science,
including causality, decision theory, and ethics of/about AI. My thesis was advissed by Professor
Danielle Wenner and focused on how an individual's beliefs affect their conception of themselves
and their relationships with others. A copy of my thesis can be found under the "Projects" tab.

My employment has spanned many areas, including IT support at the University of Maryland Institute for
Advanced Computer studies, where I handled Windows, Mac, and linux system administration tasks. During graduate
school, I served as a TA, grader for several courses where I was repsonsible for helping develop syllabi, 
leading recitation sections, and assiting students in office hours. In the summers of 2021 and 2022 I was
the lead instructor for an introdcutory political philosophy course, for which I was responsible for all aspects
of the course, including syllabus, lecture plans, assignments, grading, and so forth.
